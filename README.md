# Phishisng-Link-detection
Categorize a URL into phishing or legitimate 

Proposed work is an interface that provides with most accurate phishing link detection results. The goal is to train the model on a dataset of URLs to predict whether a given URL is a phishing website or a legitimate one, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of phishing detection systems, and to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat phishing attacks. The features that are extracted from the URLs are crucial in this process, they are used as inputs to the models in order to predict whether a given URL is a phishing website or a legitimate one. The project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of phishing detection systems, making it more difficult for attackers to carry out their schemes.
